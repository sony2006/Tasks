The Krantikari Yuva Sangathan (KYS) on Friday held a protest demonstration outside Delhi University’s St Stephen’s College calling for the immediate scrapping of the interview requirement for admission. While the Delhi University has asked St. Stephen’s College to grant admissions for general category students based on the Common Universities Entrance Test (CUET) scores and hold interviews only for the reserved seats on an 85:15 ratio, the college has maintained that it will continue to hold interviews for all candidates.<div> The college reserves 50 per cent of its seats for Christian students. The KYS members also burnt an effigy of the college principal after he allegedly refused to meet them.</div></p>
