    <pre style="color:brown">“Why do you always write magic in the sand of every beach you go to?” he asked as he watched her finger move through the sand in a rhythm writing the word.

        She smiled and said, “Because there is magic in the <mark>sand.”</mark>
        
        “What do you mean?” he further asked.
        
        “When you feel the sand under your feet,” she scrunched up her toes in the sand as she spoke.
        
        “And feel every granule of it, the noise of your thoughts suddenly sound like the waves.
        
       <mark > Just like magic.”</mark>
